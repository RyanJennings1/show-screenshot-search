[] Dougal, look.

[] Ohh!

Ho-ohh!

I am Chinese if you please!

Come on, Dougal, lighten up.

Uhh... Wh... Wh...

Who... Dougal, there were
Chinese people there!

Oh, right, yeah.

But they...

I mean... What is... I mean...

That's the Yin family,
they live in Chinatown.

Chinatown? There's a Chinatown
on Craggy Island?

I wouldn't have done
a Chinaman impression

if I'd known there was
a Chinaman there to see.

Why not, Ted?

(Whispers ) Because...
because it's racist.

They'll think I'm a racist. I'll
have to explain I'm not a racist.

If I don't stretch my eyes like that
from time to time, I get "Fat Eyes".

- (Revs engine )
- Ahh!

It's nothing of a racial nature!
Thanks for being so understanding!

Right, that's that.

Oh, that's that, all right.
What's that?

I ordered some new stuff for
the house, get rid of this old tat.

Dougal, you don't think
I upset those Chinese people?

I don't know.

It was like when you did that
impression of Stephen Hawking.

He was the last person
you'd expect to turn up.

That was a million to one shot.

God, he can move in that wheelchair
when he's angry.

Don't worry about it, Ted.
Did you phone Habitat?

No, Habit Hat.

Like Habitat it sells soft
furnishings but also priest clothes.

Does it not get confused
with Habitat?

No, that's never happened,
except when you just did it.

Anyway, what else did you order?

Priest's socks, really black ones.

I read in an article
about priest's socks

that priest's socks are blacker
than any other socks.

That's right.

Sometimes you see lay people
wearing apparently black socks

but if you look closely,

they're really very, very,
very, very dark blue.

That's true. I thought my
Uncle Tommy was wearing black socks

but when I looked at them closely,

they were just very, very, very,
very, very, very, dark blue.

Never buy black socks
in a normal shop.

They'll shaft you every time.

(Man ) Hello there, Father!

Hello, Colm.

- Out and about?
- I am. Same as yourself.

Good, good.

I hear you're a racist now, Father.

What?

How did you get interested
in that?

- Who said I'm a racist?
- Everyone's saying it, Father.

Should we all be racists?

What's the official line
the Church is taking?

No, no...

Only the farm takes up
most of the day

and at night
I just like a cup of tea.

I might not be able to devote
myself full time to the old racism.

- Good for you, Father!
- What?

Oh, Mrs Carberry.

Good for you! Someone had the guts
to stand up to them at last!

Coming over here,
taking our jobs and our women

and acting like
they own the fecking place!

Well done, Father! Good for you!

Good for you!
I'd like to fecking...

- Fecking Greeks!
- It's the Chinese he's after!

I'm not after the Chinese!

I don't care as long as
I can have a go at the Greeks!

They invented gayness!

Look, we're not having a go
at anybody!

I'm not a racist, all right?! God.

Feckin' Greeks!

- How's Mary?
- Fine. She got that job.

Great!
